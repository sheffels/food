# Untitled Food Project

Here are recipes for the sweet breakfast and savory lunch/dinner meal that I eat every day (a.k.a. oatmeal and veggie mush). The recipes below give the contents of one serving for each meal. In practice, we actually make bulk mixes with these ingredient ratios so we can just measure one 1 cup scoop and get the right amount of each ingredient. These meals are optimized for nutrition, ease of bulk mixing, shelf stability, and quick and easy cooking. For each meal, I give a few suggestions for substitutions you might make if you care less about one of those parameters. In general, I think these meals are a great platform for subbing in your favorite foods or whatever you have on hand to use up!


## Savory meal (lunch/dinner veggie mush)
### Recipe

Food | Volume | Notes
---|---|---
Dried cooked black beans | 6 T | Any type of bean will do
Rolled oats | 1/4 c | 
Dried sweet potato | 2 t |
Dried broccoli | 2 t |
Dried onion | 3 t |
Dried red bell pepper | 2 t |
Dried kale | 9 t |
Ground flax seeds | 1 t | Easy to find pre-ground
Ground chia seeds | 1 t | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Ground roasted sunflower seeds | 10 t | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Turmeric | 1/4 t |
Iodized salt | 1/4 t |
Black pepper | 1/4 t |
Other spices/sauces to taste | ? | I recommend paprika, garlic, and leftover sauces from takeout meals

Add 1.5 c water and cook in a microwave for 7-8 minutes or in a rice cooker.

If you're not going to bulk mix this and don't care about shelf stability as much, you could substitute canned or freshly cooked beans and fresh or frozen vegetables for the dried ingredients. The rolled oats are super quick to cook, but you could substitute any other grain (rice, quinoa) if you're not optimizing for fast cook time.

Rolled oats | 1/4 c | 
Raisins | 1/4 c |
Dried goji berries | 2 T |
Dried banana | 2 T |
Ground flax seeds | 1 t | Easy to find pre-ground
Ground chia seeds | 1 t | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Ground roasted sunflower seeds | 10 t | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Ceylon cinnamon | 3/4 t | Ceylon is important -- eating this much regular cinnamon every day is not recommended due to high coumarin content
Allspice | 1/8 t |
Ground cloves | 1/16 t |
Ground cardamom | 1/16 t | 
Other spices/sauces to taste | ? | 

Add 1 c water and cook in a microwave for 6-7 minutes or in a rice cooker.

You could substitute peanut butter or another nut butter for the sunflower seeds (or just throw a dollop of peanut butter in on top of everything else). You can substitute fresh or frozen fruits for the dried fruits if you don't care about shelf stability.
