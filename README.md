# Untitled Food Project

Here are recipes for the sweet breakfast and savory lunch/dinner meal that I eat every day (a.k.a. "breakfast mush" and "veggie mush"). The recipes below give the volumes for one serving and the volumes required to mix a 48-meal bulk mix. You can mix a batch of 48 at home, then each meal just take a scoop of veggie mix and a scoop of seed mix, add water, and cook (or bring the dry mixes with you to work in a tupperware or mason jar, then add water and microwave at lunchtime). These meals are optimized for nutrition, ease of bulk mixing, shelf stability, and quick and easy cooking. I think they are also a great platform for subbing in your favorite foods or whatever you have on hand to use up! The dry veggie mix, breakfast mix, and seed/spice mix should be shelf stable for > 6 months.

For those interested in ordering mush from me, please use this [order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PKqIQ0UL2ht2KZra3q6f73Jv5bUDTKSzn7ICVo5kI8s/edit).

For those interested in making your own bulk mixes, I have linked my suggested sources for ordering bulk quantities of each ingredient. I recommend getting 5-gallon buckets with lids to mix and store your veggie mix and breakfast mix, and smaller buckets or even plastic storage bins for holding your bulk seed/spice mixes. But large bags will do just fine as well!

Please share with anyone who is interested!

[Rolled oats](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/grains/oats/rolled/1lb.html) | 1/4 cup | 12 cups |
[Dried sweet potato](https://www.northbaytrading.com/air-dried-sweet-potatoes) | 2 tsp | 2 cups |
[Dried broccoli](https://www.northbaytrading.com/air-dried-broccoli) | 2 tsp | 2 cups |

[Dried kale flakes](https://www.northbaytrading.com/air-dried-kale-flakes) | 9 tsp | 9 cups |
 | | | 
Seed and spice mix (veggie version)
[Ground flax seeds](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/seeds/flax/ground-golden/1lb.html) | 1 tsp | 1 cup | Easy to find pre-ground
Ground [chia seeds](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/chia-seeds/premium/1lb.html) | 1 tsp | 1 cup | Hard to find pre-ground, grinding for ~30s in a blender works
Ground [roasted sunflower seeds](https://www.farmfreshnuts.com/product-category/seeds/sunflower/) | 10 tsp | 10 cups | Hard to find pre-ground, grinding for ~30s in a blender works
[Turmeric](https://www.americanspice.com/turmeric-ground/) | 1/4 tsp | 1/4 cup |
Iodized salt | 1/4 tsp | 1/4 cup |
[Black pepper](https://www.americanspice.com/black-pepper-shaker/) | 1/4 tsp | 1/4 cup |
Other spices/sauces to taste | ? | ? | I recommend paprika, garlic, and leftover sauces from takeout meals. We also use premixed spice mixes that you can get in bulk, such as [Ras El Hanout](https://www.spicesforless.com/seasonings/Ras-El-Hanout.html) and [Thai Spice](https://www.americanspice.com/thai-seasoning-blend/). Add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of spices per meal.

Cooking instructions for bulk mixes:
Take 1 cup of the veggie mix and 1/4 cup of the seed and spice mix and put into your bowl, pot, or rice cooker. Add 1.5 cups water and cook in a microwave for 6 minutes, on a stovetop for about 10 minutes, or in a rice cooker.

If you're not going to bulk mix this and don't care about shelf stability as much, you could substitute canned or freshly cooked beans and fresh or frozen vegetables for the dried ingredients. The rolled oats are super quick to cook, but you could substitute any other grain (rice, quinoa) if you're not optimizing for fast cook time.

You could substitute peanut butter or another nut butter for the sunflower seeds (or just throw a dollop of peanut butter in on top of everything else). You can substitute fresh or frozen fruits for the dried fruits if you don't care about shelf stability.
