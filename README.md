Here are recipes for the sweet breakfast and savory lunch/dinner meal that I eat every day (a.k.a. oatmeal and veggie mush). The recipes below give the ingredients for one serving for each meal and the volumes required to mix a 48-meal bulk mix. It's easy to mix a batch of 48 at home, then just take a scoop in a tupperware or mason jar with you, and add water and microwave at your destination. These meals are optimized for nutrition, ease of bulk mixing, shelf stability, and quick and easy cooking. For each meal, I give a few suggestions for substitutions you might make if you care less about one of those parameters. In general, I think these meals are a great platform for subbing in your favorite foods or whatever you have on hand to use up! The dry veggie mix and seed/spice mix should be shelf stable for > 6 months.


## Savory meal (lunch/dinner veggie mush)
### Recipe

Food | Volume (1 meal) | Volume (48 meal bulk mix) | Notes
---|---|---|---
Veggie mix
Dried precooked black beans | 6 T | 18 cups | Any type of bean will do
Rolled oats | 1/4 c | 12 cups |
Dried sweet potato | 2 t | 2 cups |
Dried broccoli | 2 t | 2 cups |
Dried onion | 3 t | 3 cups |
Dried red bell pepper | 2 t | 2 cups |
Dried kale flakes | 9 t | 9 cups |
 | | | 
Seed and spice mix
Ground flax seeds | 1 t | 1 cup | Easy to find pre-ground
Ground chia seeds | 1 t | 1 cup | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Ground roasted sunflower seeds | 10 t | 10 cups | Hard to find pre-ground, a blender works
Turmeric | 1/4 t | 1/4 cup |
Iodized salt | 1/4 t | 1/4 cup |
Black pepper | 1/4 t | 1/4 cup |
Other spices/sauces to taste | ? | ? | I recommend paprika, garlic, and leftover sauces from takeout meals

Take 1 cup of the veggie mix and 1/4 cup of the seed and spice mix and put into your bowl, pot, or rice cooker. Add 1.5 c water and cook in a microwave for 7-8 minutes, on a stovetop for about 10 minutes, or in a rice cooker.

If you're not going to bulk mix this and don't care about shelf stability as much, you could substitute canned or freshly cooked beans and fresh or frozen vegetables for the dried ingredients. The rolled oats are super quick to cook, but you could substitute any other grain (rice, quinoa) if you're not optimizing for fast cook time.

Other spices/sauces to taste | ? | ? |

You could substitute peanut butter or another nut butter for the sunflower seeds (or just throw a dollop of peanut butter in on top of everything else). You can substitute fresh or frozen fruits for the dried fruits if you don't care about shelf stability.
